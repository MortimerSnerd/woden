Simple roguelike project in using the Lobster language.

Just playing around with the idea of a old school roguelike that 
where there's a smaller cell resolution used for wall tiles and
viz calculations than the cell size of the characters.  Makes the 
shadows a little more defined, and may be interesting for wall
destruction mechanics. Not much more implemented than the graphics
handling.

Not making bad 3d physics handling code is refreshing.

More importantly, under src/core, src/data are a group of libraries I've copied
and modified over several projects. For now there are here, but they should really
go into another repository where can subproject reference them.
